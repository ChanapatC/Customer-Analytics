**What's CLV ?**
Customer Lifetime Value (CLV or LTV) is a crucial metric in marketing and business that represents the total estimated revenue a customer is expected to generate for a company over the entire duration of their relationship with that company.

Historic CLV: Actual value generated by customers in the past based on historical data.

Predicted CLV: Estimated future value that customers are expected to bring based on behavioral and predictive models.

## There're 5 method for calculating the lifetime valuse of a customer

### 1. ARPU
Average revenue per user

### 2. Cohort analysis
A cohort is a group of customers who have similar characteristics and made their first purchase during the same month in their customer journeys. Using cohort analysis, you calculate the average revenue per cohort instead of per user.

If you don’t have flat yearly sales, you can rely on a traditional CLV formula.

### 5. LTV Report
The LTV report in Google Analytics can tell you data on users’ behavior at their first stages of interaction with the company based on page views, goals, events, and trends. Basically, you just click the buttons to generate a report and Google Analytics breaks it down for you.
