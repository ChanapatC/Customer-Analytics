# Customer Single View (CSV)

## What is CSV?
An accessible and consistent set of information about how a customer has interacted with your company,
including what they have bought, their personal data, opinions and feedback.

The centralized database that consolidates a customer's information and interactions across all business touchpoints. It provides a 360-degree view of the customer, enabling better customer experiences, personalized interactions, and improved relationship management. Businesses can use it to anticipate needs, resolve issues, and tailor marketing efforts effectively.

## The benefits of having a single customer view?
The single customer view should sit at the heart of your business. It gives all departments valuable information to improve their performance. Executives, for example, have more accurate data to make decisions, marketers to deliver more profitable campaigns, and customer support agents to solve issues faster.

## The Key Elements Of Customer Single View

4. Communication Preferences: Data on the customer's preferred communication channels and frequency of engagement.
5. Social Media Activity: Insights from the customer's interactions on social media platforms, including sentiment analysis.
6. Customer Service Records: Details of customer inquiries, complaints, and resolutions.
