## 1) Import Dataset

**Provided Dataset**
- Data member: master data of downline and their sponsor
- trasaction 2021-2023: sales by bill (json file)

## 2) Data Preparation

1. Cleansing data

*Google Colab:*
[![Open In Collab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/ChanapatC/Customer-Analytics/blob/main/clean_jason.ipynb)

2. Create product master table
   - by SKU
   - create price per unit
3. Join transaction table with product master table and validate sales data each year.

4. List of SCV features

## 4)Interpreting Resulys

**Clustering Characteristics**

name cluster;
- Cluster 0 = Major major
- Cluster 1 = New star
- Cluster 2 = Survivor
- Cluster 3 = Passive incomer
- Cluster 4 = Lovely introductor

**Further step**
- Doing Social network analysis; for getting relationship or downline and upline such as sales volume, similarity of product categories and etc.
- silhouette analysis; it's better than k-median
- separate sales channel analysis; clustering in order to sperate offline and online sales
